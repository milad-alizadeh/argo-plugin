 * (`renderedComponents` come from the real render — base kit components self-ID
 * via `data-argo-component` — not the generator's claims). Output shape is
 * identical to `classifyCoverage`, so it feeds `summarize` / the coverage
 * receipt / the gate unchanged.
 *
 * Semantics: `present` when the disposition's component rendered; instance
 * CONSUMPTION means N distinct regions on the same component need N rendered
 * instances (first-come), a shortfall is MISSING; `deferred` for a
 * `deferred-to-*` row; UNACCOUNTED for a rendered component no built-here

 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE LIMITATIONS (both delegated, not bugs):
 * 1. PLACEMENT-BLIND. This proves the right components rendered in the right
 *    QUANTITY, never that they sit in the correct regions — option B discarded
 *    `classifyCoverage`'s path/position check (a DOM has no matching path). A
 *    screen rendering the right components in the WRONG regions scores clean
 *    here; placement correctness is delegated to the screen-level GESTALT gate
 *    + reviewer. Do not read a clean coverage receipt as proof of layout.
 * 2. NAME-KEYED. Matching keys on `region.name` via `findDisposition`, so two
 *    contract regions sharing a name (C3a's repeated-composite case) collapse
 *    to one disposition row, distinguishable only by consumption count — the
 *    Figma side's path-level distinction is not recoverable on the code side.
