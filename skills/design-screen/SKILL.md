description: Build out an EXISTING screen (or wave of screens) in Figma autonomously — ONE long-lived designer session works a BUILD-ORDER wave component-first, straight to hi-fi from the PRD, gated by a single hard tier-0 audit plus a cheap deterministic instance-presence check and an advisory completeness pass. The design analog of /argo:build-plan. Use when a screen's PRD exists (a rough wireframe is optional context) and you want the hi-fi built hands-off; for a single component jump straight to /argo:figma-create.

# Design a Screen (hi-fi in Figma, single-session, component-first, PRD-driven)

The **automated** design stage of the canonical loop: take a screen whose intent
already exists (a **PRD**, optionally a rough wireframe for reference) and build
its hi-fi in Figma, component-first, so it turns cleanly into code. This is the
simplified flow (design-process-simplification.md, 2026-07-07): the old
contract-freeze / region-coverage / structural-receipt / wireframe-verifier
machinery is retired. It was disproportionate bookkeeping — maintaining a second
synced lo-fi artifact per screen — for a solo designer with settled taste and a
known product shape.

Why one long-lived session (like `build-plan`): a wave's components are built in
dependency order, then composed — a fresh context per component re-reads the
inventory every time.

## What the PRD owns vs the design layer

- **The PRD is the spec and the completeness oracle.** Its feature→screen matrix
  and `Visible in build?` requirement rows define what each screen must DO. The
  PRD stays PURE semantic — product-owned, durable, independent of layout. It does
  NOT carry component names or arrangement.
- **The component/copy DECISIONS live in the binding manifest (P0 below); the
  arrangement still lives on the frame.** The retired Dev Mode annotation
  contract (design doc decision 9) is NOT back — the binding manifest
  (design-phase-quality-plan.md W1) is a different artifact at a different
  altitude: it declares which registry component realizes each requirement
  (the decision), never coordinates or arrangement. P4a's deterministic check
  still resolves every INSTANCE in the composed frame's tree directly against
  `design/registry.json` by `nodeId`. Reading the built tree to grade the
  builder is NOT the circularity the LLM check guards against — a structural
  "does every instance resolve" check is legitimate; the ban on grading a plan
  against itself is on the P4b advisory pass, which never sees this tree data.

## 1. Preconditions — check all, fail loudly
- **A PRD** for the feature (`.claude/prds/<feature>.md`) with a feature→screen
  matrix and `Visible in build?` rows for this screen. No PRD → stop; author it
  first (`/argo:write-prd`).
- **A wireframe is OPTIONAL** — reference context only, never frozen or verified
  against. Use one only when a screen's layout is a genuine open question; skip it
  when the shape is known.
- **A reference image is optional-but-strongly-recommended** on every screen
  brief (`Reference image` input: a wireframe export, an annotated sibling
  screenshot, or the original design). If the brief has NO reference image and
  the screen is not a sibling-clone patch, the designer **STOPS AND ASKS** for
  one — or for explicit permission to proceed prose-only — never silently
  interprets prose alone (the observed fidelity misses were prose-misread
  failures). When present, it is the comparison target for the content
  self-check (see P4b below).
- **INVENTORY / RECONCILIATION / BUILD-ORDER** mounted **READ-ONLY** — the
  anti-recreation authority. The net-new budget is a ceiling only a human raises.
- **design-guard armed** (the app's `design.<app>` block present in
  `.claude/argo.json`, so the tier-0 stop gate + commit gate fire).
- **Figma MCP reachable** (load tools via ToolSearch if deferred): `get_metadata`,
  `get_screenshot`, plus the create tools the designer uses.

## 2. Decide first (P0: binding manifest), then build component-first (P1), then compose (P2)

**P0 — the DECISION pass (binding manifest, required before any `use_figma`
composition).** The two highest-risk decisions — which existing component, and
what copy — are made HERE, as a written, checkable artifact, never inside the
authoring turn (design-phase-quality-plan.md W1). Per screen, BEFORE touching
`use_figma`:

1. Emit `design/<wave>/binding-manifest.json` (schema:
   `BindingManifestSchema`, `@argohq/kit/design-kit`): one row per PRD
   requirement / region this screen realizes —
   `requirement → registry component → variant/states → purpose in ONE
   clause`. Resolve each component by `argo design registry-lookup` reading
   `whenToUse` (re-read the entry again right before authoring that component
   — the manifest-consume re-orient). For the single **highest-risk** row
   (the composite most likely to be confused), list the top-2 candidates in
   `alternatesConsidered` and pick by `whenToUse` overlap, recording the
   one-line comparison in `justification`.
2. Emit `design/<wave>/copy-deck.json` (schema: `CopyDeckSchema`) from the
   PRD's wave-scoped Copy deck section. ALL authored canvas text comes from
   this deck; a string the deck doesn't carry → **STOP AND ASK** (never invent
   filler); any string used in >1 region rides the `sharedTerms` block and is
   referenced by key, never retyped.
3. Run `argo design validate-manifest --manifest <path> --cwd <app-dir>` —
   the independent check ON the decision (W2). It lints every row against
   `design/registry.json` (existence), applies the committed
   `design/confusable-pairs.json` table (a row on a known confused pair needs
   an explicit `justification`), and applies the three-tier guardrail below.
   **Exit 1 = blocked: STOP AND ASK the human — do not build.** Moving the
   decision earlier without checking it just relocates the error.

**Three-tier component-choice guardrail (the contract, decidable at
generation time):**

- **Always** — the row names an existing registry component whose `whenToUse`
  matches the region/pattern: use it, no ask needed.
- **Ask-first** — no registry candidate's `whenToUse` clearly matches (or the
  candidate carries none): STOP AND ASK before composing; record the answer
  as `humanApproved: true` on the row.
- **Never** — invent a component name silently, or hand-assemble a region
  from primitives past an existing candidate. No exceptions; validate-manifest
  hard-blocks these rows.

**Component Bindings (PRD hint layer, feeds P0).** The PRD's optional
`Component Bindings` section pre-seeds manifest rows: verify each entry ONCE
(`get_metadata`: exists, right type, fits the brief) before writing it into
the manifest. Absent or failed → your own `registry-lookup` pass per the tiers
above. The PRD section is a hint layer; the manifest flow is standalone and
works without it. When AUTHORING a new component, write its `@when-to-use:`
Dev annotation (figma-create's usage marker step) so the registry stays
self-describing.

Walk BUILD-ORDER: `figma-create` each composite in dependency order — audit-gated,
registered, with the registry as the reuse authority (check it before proposing
anything NEW). An unmatched composite ESCALATES to a
human — NEVER auto-`NEW` past the budget. Only when the components exist do you
compose the screen from **instances** (not fresh frames).

**Compose region-by-region with a checkpoint per region:** work through the
brief's region list in order; after each major region lands, take ONE inline
screenshot of that region (`await regionNode.screenshot()` in the same
`use_figma` call as its last write) and fix visible defects BEFORE the next
region. This replaces an end-only self-review of the composed frame — it does
NOT add extra full-screen audits (the P3 one-audit cap stands), and it stays
lightweight: one screenshot per region, no per-region re-audits.

Right after composing a screen, **mark its identity**: a screen frame is a plain FRAME with **no
`description` field** (plain frames are not `PublishableMixin`), so screen
identity rides a Dev Mode annotation, not the `@code-owned:` description model.
Set a `@screen`-labelled annotation on the top-level frame
(`node.setAnnotations([{ label: '@screen' }])`) AND run
`argo design register-screen --node <frameId> --name <name> --cwd <app-dir>` to
write its `kind:"screen"` entry into `design/registry.json` — that entry is what
exempts the screen's own artboard from the 3 tier-0 rules it structurally always
trips (`non-code-friendly-name`, `missing-auto-layout`, `non-semantic-binding`).
Then run `argo design mark-screen-composed --screen <name>` so the stop gate
knows its P4b completeness check is owed (re-composing re-owes it).

`design/registry.json` (component name → node id, committed on `main`) is the
**code bridge** — the mapping that lets code generation resolve each instance to
its real component. (This is the on-device substitute for Figma Code Connect,
which is Org/Enterprise-only; nothing here depends on the paid feature.)

## 3. tier-0 audit — the one hard gate (P3)
Run the named tier-0 audit on every component built and on the composed screen.
It enforces build hygiene: Semantic-token binding, auto-layout intent, semantic
names, variant naming, and **real instances, not traced frames** (the
`composite-region-traced-not-instance` check — advisory today, promoted to a hard
fail after one NEW-composite calibration wave confirms the wrapper-frame
exemption is clean). A hard violation fails loud; the session cannot end without a
clean per-session tier-0 receipt (`design-guard-stop`).

Auto-layout is checked for *intent*, not rigidly: a deliberate absolute-canvas
frame (backdrop / orb-scene / overlay whose children are all absolutely
positioned) is exempt — auto-layout would be a no-op there.

**One mechanical pass (P3 cap):** the tier-0 audit is deterministic — run it
once per component/screen and re-run ONLY after actual fixes, never as a
repeat sweep. The visual content self-check is separate and stays (see
designer.md) — and when the brief carries a `Reference image`, that check
compares the built screenshot against the REFERENCE IMAGE, not against your
own reading of the prose (prose-misread was the observed fidelity failure
mode; prose-only comparison is the fallback only when the human explicitly
approved proceeding without a reference).

## 4. Completeness — deterministic pre-check + advisory check, then you (P4)
No frozen contract; completeness is a cheap layered check:
- **(a) Deterministic instance-presence pre-check (cheap, advisory-loud):**
  assert every INSTANCE in the composed frame's tree resolves to a
  `design/registry.json` entry by `nodeId` — no declared list, no manifest.
  Capture the frame's flat instance inventory in ONE `use_figma` read (each
  descendant's `{ nodeId, name, type }` — no `componentName`/`childCount`
  needed anymore, since there's no HOLLOW/cardinality concept), then run
  `argo design check-instance-presence --built '<inventory JSON>'` (reads
  `design/registry.json` Node-side). It reports each instance `resolved` or
  `unresolved` (resolved by `nodeId` first, falling back to a normalized name
  match). An unresolved instance fails here, for free, before any LLM spend —
  the cheapest catch, replacing the old region-coverage gate without a
  contract. It is **advisory-loud**: the command exits non-zero when not clean
  so you notice and fix (or override at ship), but NO hook consumes that exit
  — tier-0 stays the one hard gate.
- **(b) In-loop mechanical completeness (designer, before reporting done) +
  advisory blind check (must-exist, non-blocking on content):**
  generate the checklist **mechanically** with
  `argo design completeness-checklist --screen <matrix-name> --prd <path>` — it
  selects the PRD requirements the feature→screen matrix disposes `covered-by`
  this screen whose `Visible in build?` is `yes`/`partial` (deterministic; the
  verifier never picks its own scope). **The designer first runs this
  checklist itself and fixes any ABSENT mechanical/enumerable presence item
  in-session** — scope is structural presence only (is the enumerated thing
  there at all), no fidelity judgement. Then spawn the **design-verifier** agent with
  that checklist + the built screenshots ONLY (never the arrangement note, never
  this transcript) → it rules each requirement present/absent. **Narrow its
  job to the manifest (W5, the token offset that keeps the P0 pass
  net-neutral): the spawn prompt gives it the screen's binding-manifest rows
  + checklist and asks "does the canvas match the manifest" — per row, is the
  named component present as a real instance in the named variant/states —
  never an open-ended re-derivation of intent from the screenshot. The blind
  verifier remains mandatory and BLIND (never the build transcript, never the
  self-report) and keeps its model tier — narrow the scope, never the
  capability: a passing in-loop checklist NEVER downgrades or skips it.** The
  supervisor-spawned fidelity verifier is likewise narrowed: it rules
  region-by-region against the brief's REQUIRED reference image at identical
  frame size (see orchestrate §5), same blind + full-tier contract. Then run
  `argo design record-completeness --screen <name> --result '<summary>'` —
  honestly (record what the check actually found). Screen names are aliased:
  the PRD matrix name (`D02-5-session-with-children`) and the composed frame
  name (`D02.5 · Session · with children`) normalize to one key, so either
  form satisfies the stop gate against `mark-screen-composed`. Missing PRD →
  the §1 stop-and-ask, not a silent skip. You MAY
  override an "absent" flag and ship, but the check MUST have RUN — the stop gate
  blocks a composed screen whose completeness was never recorded (existence only,
  never on what it found; closes the D01 "silent because skipped" gap without
  content-blocking). For a pure recompose of banked instances, (a) alone may
  suffice; for a NEW composite or high PRD-REQ density, always run (b).
- **(c) You** make the ship call, informed by (a) + (b). Never cut the visual
  self-review round.

## 5. Land (P5)
figma-sync → committed artifacts; the integrator commits the design worktree.

## Two-phase orchestration (DEFAULT — the efficient shape)
For a wave/batch of screens, do NOT build each screen end-to-end in isolation —
that re-pays the composite-build cost per screen. Instead:

1. **Composite front-load (SERIAL).** Build every NEW/EXTEND/RECONCILE composite a
   wave needs FIRST, in a few serial sessions (one writer — two sessions must
   never author the same NEW master). Each base master a wave touches must be
   `audit-clean` in `registry.json` before the wave starts. This amortizes the
   ~30–50k per-session context tax and banks the shared components once.
1b. **Bank ONE canonical shell template per wave (SERIAL, before fan-out).**
   Once the composites exist, assemble a single **shell-only** frame — the
   layout chrome every screen in the wave shares (outer frame/backdrop + the
   surrounding panels/bars around an empty content region), no
   screen-specific content — and audit it clean. Record in the wave's
   **BUILD-ORDER doc, once**: the shell template's `nodeId`, its frame
   dimensions, and its content-region slot map (region name → child node id).
   Fan-out screens then `.clone()` **that banked nodeId** and patch only the
   content region from the recorded slot map — they NEVER re-read the shell's
   metadata dump to rediscover its structure (a single such dump has run
   ~101KB — banking the structure in the BUILD-ORDER pays that read once for
   the whole wave, not once per screen). This is the structural form of the
   clone-not-rebuild rule below, and it structurally forecloses the
   stale-copy and backdrop-bleed defect classes that hit every screen that
   hand-reconstructs the shell.
2. **Compose fan-out (PARALLEL, ~3-wide).** Once a wave's composites AND the
   canonical shell template (1b) are banked, screens only place instances on
   their OWN frames — no shared master mutation, so parallel compose is
   collision-free with no lock needed. Serialize ONLY the P5 registry/receipt
   commit through the single on-device writer (integrator).

Front-loading is the dominant token lever (composition-dominant screens cost
~75k, not ~300k); parallelism is a wall-time bonus, not the strategy.

## Cost discipline (hard rules)
- **Clone the shared shell, never reconstruct it.** Clone the wave's banked
  canonical shell template (step 1b) by its recorded `nodeId` —
  `(await figma.getNodeByIdAsync('<banked-shell-id>')).clone()` — or, if no
  shell was banked, a sibling screen that already carries the shared layout
  chrome (its outer frame/backdrop and the surrounding panels/bars around the
  content region). Then swap ONLY the content region + the copy slots that
  differ, driven by the recorded slot map — do NOT re-read the shell's
  metadata to rediscover it, and do NOT re-derive the shared chrome
  node-by-node from an inspected reference — that re-pays the whole
  scaffold cost and re-discovers the same Plugin API constraints (e.g. an
  absolute-positioned backdrop is rejected under a `layoutMode:NONE` parent;
  a SLOT node ignores `.resize()` — size the containing instance) on every
  build. Cloning is materially cheaper in round-trips and tokens, and a clone
  inherits the shell's already-filled, opaque surfaces, so backdrop-bleed and
  stale-placeholder-copy defects can't reappear.
- **The full-tree read is reserved for the P4a instance-presence check ONLY** —
  a single `use_figma` walk of the composed frame's flat instance inventory.
  P1/P2 read the committed registry + the component-resolution
  manifest — NEVER re-pull the tree "to check structure" mid-build (the single
  largest redundant spend).
- **Pre-seed the validated binding manifest** (the P0 artifact — requirement →
  component → variant → purpose, already validate-manifest-clean) into every
  designer session. Resolve by lookup against it; fire a live component-page
  search only on a genuine miss (and then update + re-validate the manifest,
  never compose past it).
- **Never instance a component from a guessed/remembered/committed node id —
  resolve it LIVE** (figma-create §"check before you build"): everything is
  local to the design file, so a stale id is a `getNodeByIdAsync` null / failed
  `findAll`, which stop-the-line (R8) acts on. Re-resolve once, then stop; never
  retry the same id.
- **Read protocol — `get_design_context` FIRST, `get_metadata` is fallback
  only.** To inspect a node, read `get_design_context` on the exact node id
  first (token-optimized: tokens/components/styles pre-resolved). Only when that
  result is too large, fall back to `get_metadata` for a lightweight id/structure
  map, then re-fetch ONLY the required node(s). Never metadata-first, and NEVER
  `get_metadata`/select a whole page or heavy frame (documented #1 MCP failure —
  a whole-page dump has overflowed a live session at ~102k chars); target a node
  id and narrow a large subtree before reading.
- **Author tier-0-compliant up front** (naming / Semantic binding / auto-layout)
  rather than create→audit→fix→re-audit round-trips.
- **Capture screenshots inline** (`await node.screenshot()` in the finishing write
  call) — never the get_screenshot → curl → Read round-trip loop.

## Session shape & recovery
Durable on-disk state (registry, receipts, progress doc) + the Figma file survive
an interruption; wrap each designer session in `orchestrate`'s bounded-retry loop
so a crash restarts ONE screen, not the batch; rate-limit recovery inherits
`orchestrate` §4.
